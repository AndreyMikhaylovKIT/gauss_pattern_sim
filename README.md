# gauss_pattern_sim
Module for Python to simulate Gauss patterns.

Functions gauss_single_flat and gauss_single_full creating a single Gauss function on a  square nxn.

gauss_multiple_flat sumulates ideal pattern of NxN gaussians each sampled on n*n square. Amplitudes and sigmas are equal to 1.


gauss_multiple_full simulates gaussian pattern. All parameters of each gaussian are tunable. To change order of gaussian, access line 156.
